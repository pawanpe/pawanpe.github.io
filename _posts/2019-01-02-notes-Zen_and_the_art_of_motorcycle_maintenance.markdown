# PART 1 (CHAPTERS 1-7)

## CHAPTER 1:
1. It's all the technology they can't take. And then all sorts of things started tumbling into place.

## CHAPTER 2:
1. The mechanics in their own way were achieving the same thing John and Sylvia were, living with tech without really having anything to do with it. Or rather, they had something to do with it, but their ownselves wer outside of it, detached, removed. They wer involved in it but not in such a way AS TO CARE.
2. Agreement of anything with SPECTATOR ATTITUDE (without any care) is how most of the work is done now. Neither a good nor a strong work ethic.

## CHAPTER 3:
1. What it means is that the law of gravity exists no where except in people's heads! It's a ghost! We are all of us very arrogant and conceited about running down other people's ghosts but just as ignorant and barbaric and superstitious about our own. 
2. "Why does everyone believe in law of gravity then? Mass hypnosis. In a very orthodox form known as 'education'."
3. "You have heard of the importance of eye contact in the classroon. Every educationist emphasizes it. No educationist explains it."
4. The problem, the contradiction the scientists are stuck with, is that of mind. Mind has no matter or energy but they can't escape its predominance over everything they do. Logic exists in the mind. Numbers exist onlly in the mind. I don;t get upset when scientsts say that ghosts exist in the mind. It;s that only that gets me. Science is only in your mind too, it;s just that thay doesn't make it bad. Or ghosts either.
5. Laws of nature are human inventions, like ghosts. Laws of logid, of mathematics are also human inventionals, like hosts.World is all a ghost, and in antiquity was so recognized as a ghost, the whole blessed works we live in. We see what the earlier ghosts show us. Ghosts of Moses, Christ, Buddhaa, Plaato, Descartes, Newton, Lincoln.

## CHAPTER 5:
1. Different understanding of reality. What shim is v/s what shim made of v/s what is shim?

## CHAPTER 6:
1. Classical v/s Romantic understanding. A classical understanding sees the works primarily as underlying form itself. A romantic understanding sees it primarily in terms of immediate appearance.

## CHAPTER 7:
1. From all the awareness we must select, and what we select and call consciousness is never the same as the awareness because the process of selection mutates it. We take a handful of sand from the endless landscape of awareness around us and call that handful of sand the world. Once we have the handful of sand, the worls of which we are conscious a process of discrimination goes to work on it. This is the knife. We divide the sand into parts. This and that. Here and there. Black and White, now and then.The discrimination is the division of the conscious universe into parts.
