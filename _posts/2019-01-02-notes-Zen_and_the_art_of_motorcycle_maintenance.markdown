# PART 1 (CHAPTERS 1-7)

## CHAPTER 1:
1. It's all the technology they can't take. And then all sorts of things started tumbling into place.

## CHAPTER 2:
1. The mechanics in their own way were achieving the same thing John and Sylvia were, living with tech without really having anything to do with it. Or rather, they had something to do with it, but their ownselves wer outside of it, detached, removed. They wer involved in it but not in such a way AS TO CARE.
2. Agreement of anything with SPECTATOR ATTITUDE (without any care) is how most of the work is done now. Neither a good nor a strong work ethic.

## CHAPTER 3:
1. What it means is that the law of gravity exists no where except in people's heads! It's a ghost! We are all of us very arrogant and conceited about running down other people's ghosts but just as ignorant and barbaric and superstitious about our own. 
2. "Why does everyone believe in law of gravity then? Mass hypnosis. In a very orthodox form known as 'education'."
3. "You have heard of the importance of eye contact in the classroon. Every educationist emphasizes it. No educationist explains it."
4. The problem, the contradiction the scientists are stuck with, is that of mind. Mind has no matter or energy but they can't escape its predominance over everything they do. Logic exists in the mind. Numbers exist onlly in the mind. I don;t get upset when scientsts say that ghosts exist in the mind. It;s that only that gets me. Science is only in your mind too, it;s just that thay doesn't make it bad. Or ghosts either.
5. Laws of nature are human inventions, like ghosts. Laws of logid, of mathematics are also human inventionals, like hosts.World is all a ghost, and in antiquity was so recognized as a ghost, the whole blessed works we live in. We see what the earlier ghosts show us. Ghosts of Moses, Christ, Buddhaa, Plaato, Descartes, Newton, Lincoln.

## CHAPTER 5:
1. Different understanding of reality. What shim is v/s what shim made of v/s what is shim?

## CHAPTER 6:
1. Classical v/s Romantic understanding. A classical understanding sees the works primarily as underlying form itself. A romantic understanding sees it primarily in terms of immediate appearance.

## CHAPTER 7:
1. From all the awareness we must select, and what we select and call consciousness is never the same as the awareness because the process of selection mutates it. We take a handful of sand from the endless landscape of awareness around us and call that handful of sand the world. Once we have the handful of sand, the world of which we are conscious a process of discrimination goes to work on it. This is the knife. We divide the sand into parts. This and that. Here and there. Black and White, now and then.The discrimination is the division of the conscious universe into parts.


# PART 1 (CHAPTERS 8-15)

## CHAPTER 8:
1. FInally you see that while I was splitting the cycle up into finer and finer pieces. I was also building a structure. This structure of concepts is formally called a hierarchy and since ancient times has been a basic structure for all western knowledge. Kingdoms, empires, armies, businesses are so structured. computer software, all scientific and tech knowledge is too.
2. The fabric of society, human work, human intelligence works on this hierarchy, which is unfortunately -- disgusting sometimes.

## CHAPTER 9:
1. I talked about hierarchies of thought - the system. Now I want to talk about methods of finding one's way through these hierarchies - logic.
2. Two kinds o flogic are uses, inductive and deductive. Inductive starts with obsesrvations of the machine and arrive at general conclusions. Deductive start with general knowledge and predict a specific observation.
3. Solution of problems too complicated for common sense  to solve is achieved by long strings of mixed inductive and deductive inferences that weave back and forth between. The correct program for this interweaving is formalized as scientific method.  When you have hit a really tough one, tried everything, racked your brain and nothing works, then Nature has really decided to be difficult, You say, "Ok Nature that's the end of the nice guy" and crank up the formal scientific method.
4. For this you keep a lab notebok. Everything gets written down formally , so that you know at all times where you are in problem solving. In scientific work and electronics, this is necessary becoz otherwize the problwms get so comples that you get lost in them and confused and forget what you kknow and what you don;t know and have to give up.
5. The logical statements entered into the notebook are broken down into 5 (or six) cats: 
    a) Statement of problem
    b) hypothesis as to cause of the problem. -- The results of this will create more hypothesis. This frustrates, but when do we stop and make the conclusion???
    c) experiments designed to test each hypothesis
    d) predicted and observed results of the experiments
    e) conclusions of the experiment.
 6. An untrained observer will see only physical labor and often get the idea that lbor is mainly what the mechanic does. Actually the physical labor is the smallest and easiest part of what the mechanic does.. By fat the greatest part of this/her work is careful observation and precise thinking. Same with software. Learning and toining/coding is the smallest part. Use the expeimentation as part of a program to expand the hierarchy of knowledge.
 
## CHAPTER 10:
 1. Again logically speaking, as you try to move toward unchaging truth through the application of scientific methods, you actually do not move toward it at all. You move away from it! It is your application of scientific method that is caussing it to change! This is Scientifically produced anti science - chaos. This is seen in every day in human life and all across the various industries of society.
 
## CHAPTER 11:
 1. He felt that institutions such as scholls, churches, govts and political organizations of every sort all tended to direct thought for ends other than truth, for the perpetuation of their own functions and for the control of individuals in the service of these functions. Unstable govts, corruptions, profit *polies companies*, high cost education, useless university and schools.. all point to this.
 2. Lateral knowledge is knowledge that's from a wholly unexpected direction, from a direction that's not even understood as a direction until the knowledge forces itself upon one. Lateral truths point to the falseness of axioms and postulated underlying one; ecisting system of getting at truth.
 
## CHAPTER 12:
 1. It's a problem of our time. The range of human knowledge today os so great that we're all specialists and the distance between specializations has become so great that anyone who seek to wander freely among them almost has to forego closeness with the people around him/her. The lunchtime her-and-now stuff is a specialty too.
 2. Logic presumes a separation of subject from object. There fore logic is not final wisdom. The illusion of separation of sub from obj is best removed by the elimination of physical activity, mental activity and emotional activity. There are many disciplies for this and one of the most important in Sanskrit is dhyana. And also Tat tvam asi, "Thou art that", which  asserts that everything you think you are and everything you think you perceive are undivided. To realize this fully is to become enlightened.
 
## CHAPTER 13:
 1. The reason you teach and you teach and you teach is that this is a very clever way of running a college on the cheap while giving a galse appearance of genuine education.
 2. The real university is not a material object. It is not a group pf buildings that can be defended by police. The real University he said has no specific location. It is a state of  mind. The real Univ is nothing less than the continuing body of reason itself. They see professors as employees of the second university who should abandon reason when told to and take orders with no backtalk, the same way employees do in other corporations. True churchmen inn dire situations must act as though they has never heard of these threats. Their primary goal never is to serve the community ahead of everything else, but through reason, the goal of truth. That was what he meant by the Church of Reason.
 
## CHAPTER 14:
 1. Sometime look at a novice workman or a bad workman and compare his expression with that of a craftsman whose work you know is excellent and you'll see the difference. The craftsman isn't ever following a line of instruction. He's making decisions as he goes along. For that reason he'll be absorved and attentive to what he/she's doing even though he/she doesn't deliverately contrive this. His/Her motions and machine are in a kind of harmony.
 2. People haven't much paid attention to the ugliness of noncoalescence between reason and feeling of tech because the big concern has been with food, clothing and shelter for everyone and tech has provided these. Now that has been taken care and tech is improving and creating unnecessary things creating havoc in people's life like Facebook , instagram, and other useless apps/web.
 3. But what's happening is that each year our old flat earth of conventional reason becomes less and less adequate to handle the experiences we have and this is creating wide spread feelings of tipsy-turviness. As a result we are getting more and more people in irrational areas of though - occultism, mysticism, drugs, casteism, racism, ; because they feel the inadequacy of classical reason to handle what they know are real experiences.

## CHAPTER 15:
1. I hope you are teaching quality to your students.
2. Quality - you know what it is, yet you don't know what it is. Some things are better than others?
