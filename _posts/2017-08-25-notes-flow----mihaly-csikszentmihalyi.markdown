<b style="color: brown">Chapter 7 -- Work as Flow</b>

1. A person at work should have 'autotelic personality' or the ability to create flow experiences even in the most barren environment.
2. The view that work undertaken as a flow activity is the best way to fulfill human potential.
3. Work transforms the worker from an animal guided by instincts into a conscious, goal-directed, skillful person.
4. Taoist scholar Chuang Tzu believed that Yu (how to flow or flowing) is the proper way to live without concern for external rewards, spontaneously with total commitment- in short a total autotelic experience.
5. It is not the matter of skill.. It is about the way which goes beyond skill -- This has very deep meaning if you think.
6. Mystical heights of Yu can be attained by the gradual focusing of attention on the "opportunities for action" in one's environment not by some superhuman quantum jump.
7. Life should resemble like game for increasing the quality -- with variety, appropriate and flexible challenges, clear goals and immediate feedback.
8. The quality of work experience can be transformed at will. What makes work special and quality is the feeling one gets from the activity itself.
9. Conflict at  work is often due to himself he sets certain goals for how others should treat him and then expects rigidly that others will fulfill those expectations. This rarely happens as planned, however, because others also have an agenda for their own rigid goals to be achieved. Best to way to avoid this is to set challenge of reaching one's goals while helping colleagues reach theirs.
10. There are 100s of ways to relieve stress, some based on better organization, delegation of responsibility, better communication with co-workers and supervisors, others are based on factors external to the job as improved home live, leisure patterns and inner disciplines.
11. The future will belong not only to the educated man but to the man whos is educated to user his leisure wisely. -- C.K. Brightbill


<b style="color: brown">Chapter 9 -- Cheating Chaos</b>

When a person knows that he/she is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.

The good things which belong to prosperity are to be wishes, but the good things that belong to adversity(difficulties) are to be admired.

A hopeless situation is to be transformed into flow activity
1. Unselfconscious self-assurance -- The attitude occurs when  person no longer sees himself in opposition to the environment, ass an individual who insists that his goals, his intentions take precedence over everything else.
2. Focus attention on the world: The person whose attention is immersed in the environment becomes part of it -- becomes part of the system by linking herself to it through psychic energy. Example in 2016 -- how dangerous excessive concern with safety can get, when it demands so much attention that it makes us oblivious to the rest of reality

Autotelic self:
A self that has self-contained goals. Can transform an entropic experience into flow. Below are some rules to develop that personality:
1. Setting goals -- Diff b/w autotelic self and one without is that the former knows that it is she who has chosen whatever foal she is pursing. What she does is not ransom, nor is it the result of outside determining forces.
2. Becoming immersed in the activity -- with flow. Involvement greatly facilitated by the ability to concentrate.
3. Paying attention to what is happening.
4. Learning to enjoy immediate experience -- It is not sufficient to learn merely how to control moment by moment states of consciousness. It is also important to have an overall context of goals in everydays events.
	a. If a person moves from one flow activity to another without a connecting order, it will be difficult at the end of one's life to look back on the years past and find meaning in what has happened.

VERY IMP: Flow is a task that involves transforming the entirety of life into a single flow activity, with unified goals that provide constant purpose.
	
<b style="color: brown">Chapter 6 -- The Flow of Thought</b>

1. Wonder is the seed of knowledge and is the reflection of the purest form of pleasure.
2. Contrary to what we tend to assume the normal state of the mind is chaos. We need to consciously spend time to make more mindful and useful. Entropy is the normal state of mindfulness which is neither useful not enjoyable -- brings back just the pain memories.. That why we feel pain when we think before sleeping.
3. Greeks personified memory as lady Mnemosyne, mother of the nine Muses.
4. Knowledge that is seen to be controlled from the outside is acquired with reluctance, and it brings no job -- like education by going to school. Should be from inside when person finds the meaning and experience a full-fledged flow experience.
5. The mental framework that makes science enjoyable and accessible to everyone is that it involves curiosity, careful observation, a disciplined way of recording events and finding ways to tease out the underlying regularities in what one learns. It also requires the humility to be willing to learn from the results of past investigators, couples with enough skepticism and openness of mind to reject beliefs that are not supported by facts.
6. If flow, rather than success and recognition is the measure by which to judge its value, then science can contribute immensely to the quality of life.

<b style="color: brown">Chapter 2 -- Anatomy of Consciousness</b>

What does it mean to be conscious?
1. It simply means that certain specific conscious events(sensations, feelings, thoughts, intentions) are occurring and that we able to direct their course.
2. Our brain over a life time is approximated to process around 185 GB of events.
	
Attention is the most important tool in attaining the task of improving our quality of experience.

<b style="color: brown">Chapter 4 -- Conditions of Flow</b>

What is religion?
• One of the earliest ball games, a form of basketball played by Maya, was part of their religious celebration and so were the original Olympic games. This connection iss not surprising, because what we call religion is actually the oldest and most ambitious attempt to create order In consciousness. It therefore makes sense that religious rituals would be a profound source of enjoyment.

What is culture?
• Cultures are defensive constructions against chaos, designed to reduce the impact of randomness on experience. They are adaptive responses, just as feathers are for birds and fur is for mammals. They prescribe norms, evolve goals build beliefs that help us tackle the challenges of existence and channeling attention to a limited set of goals.
When a culture succeeds in evolving a set of goals and rules so compelling and so well matched to the skills of the population that its members are able to experience flow with unusual frequency and intensity. ExL Athenian citizens of Romans, Chinese intellectuals or Indian Brahmins moved through life with intricate(detailed and complicated) grace.

• A major element of the American experiment in democracy has been to make the pursuit of happiness a conscious political goal -- indeed a responsibility of the government.
• Morality simply no longer has currency outside own's culture.
• Read pages 84-85 completely.
	
How to raise a child
1. Read pages 88-89
2. The family context promoting optimal experience could ve described as having 5 characteristics
a. Clarity
b. Centering --- child perception that parents are interested in what they are doing in present rather then preoccupied with whether getting into a good college or obtaining a well paying job.
c. Choice
d. Commitment -- child to feel comfy enough to set aside the shield of defenses
e. Challenge -- provide increasingly complex opportunities for action to their children.
	
<b style="color: brown">Chapter 8 -- Enjoying solitude and other people</b>

1. Quality of life experience on two factors:
a. How we experience work
b. Our relations with other people
2. A same person can make the morning wonderful and evening miserable. Why?
a. Because we depend so much on the affection and approval of others, we are extremely vulnerable to how we are treated by them.
3. But people are important only because they can help make our goals come true; when they are treated as valuable in their own right, people are the most fulfilling source of happiness.
4. Filling free time with activities that require concentration, that increase skills, that lead to a development of the self, is not the same as killing time by watching television or raking recreational drugs. Although both strategies seem to as different ways of coping with the same threat of chaos, as defense mechanism, one leads to growth and latter e=merely serves to keep the mind  from unraveling.
5. Learning to use time alone, instead of escaping from it, is especially important in our early years. Teenagers who cannot know it will try for tv, friends chatting, useless activities.
6. A community should be judged good not because it is tech advanced or swimming in material riches, it is good if it offers people a chance to enjoy as many aspects of their lives as  possible, while allowing them to develop their potential in the pursuit of ever greater challenges. Similarly the value of a school doesn't depend on its prestige, or its ability to train students to face up to the necessities of life, but rather on the degree of the enjoyment of lifelong learning ir can transmit.
7. A young man asked Carlyle how he should go about reforming the worked, Carlyle answered, 'Reform yourself. That way there will be one less rascal in the world. '

<b style="color: brown">Chapter 10 --Making of Meaning</b>

1. If a person sets out to achieve a difficult enough goal, from which all other goals logically follow and if he or she invests all energy in developing skills to read that goal, then actions and feelings will be harmony and the separate parts of life will fit together and each activity will make sense.
2. In default life has no meaning but it doesnot follow that life cannot be given a meaning.
3. Meaning is a concept difficult to define, since any definition runs the risl of being circular.
4. Purpose gives direction to one's efforts, but it doesnot necessarily make life easier. Goals can lead into all sorts of trouble, at which point one tempted to face them up and find some less demanding script by which to order one's actions.
5. Know the rules of the game. US constitution and Bill of Rights
6. Dissipative structure:  Ability to draw order from disorder.
7. Schools
	a. Schools should teach the on how to make these things of life by receiving ORDERED INFORMATION from teachers, from books, from models so as to benefit from the knowledge of the past and eventually surpass it by generation after generation.

<b style="color: brown">Chapter 5 -- Body in Flow</b>

1. Even the simplest act will become enjoyable when it is transformed so as to produce flow:
a. To set an overall goal, and as many subgoals as are realistically feasible
b. To find ways of measuring progress in terms of the goals chosen
	i. For measuring progress, the feedback may include how fast and how easily the intended distance was covered how many interesting sights one has seen and how many new ideas or feelings were entertained along the way.
c. To keep concentrating on what one is doing and to keep making finer and finer distinctions in the challenges involved in the activity
d. To develop the skills necessary to interact with the opportunities available
e. To keep raising the stakes if the activity becomes boring.
2. The urge to have sex is so powerful that it can drain psychic energy away from other necessary goals. Therefore every culture has to invest great efforts in rechanneling it proper goal achievement.

<b style="color: brown">Chapter 3 -- Enjoyment and the quality of life</b>

1. Even though we recognize that material success may not being happiness, we engage in an endless struggle to reach external goals, expecting that they will improve life. Wealth, status and power have become in our culture all too powerful symbols of happiness.
2. Quality of life does not depend directly on what others think of us or on what we own, The bottom line is, rather, how we feel about ourselves and about what happens to us.
3. Instead of worrying about how to make million money and how to win friends and influence people, it seem more beneficial to find out how everyday life can be made more harmonious and more satisfying.
4. Pleasure is a feeling of contentment that one achieves whenever information in consciousness says that expectations set by biological programs or by social conditioning have been met. But Enjoyment is different. Please just helps to maintain order, but by itself cannot create new order on consciousness.
5. Enjoyment occurs when  person has not only met some prior expectations(pleasure) or satisfied a need or desire but also gone beyond what be or she has been programmed to do and achieved something unexpected, perhaps something even unimagined before.
6. The phenomenology of enjoyment has eight major components:
a. The experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing.
b. We must be able to concentrate on what we are doing.
c. The concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals
d. Goals to provide immediate feedback.
e. In acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustration of everyday life.
f. Enjoyable experience allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions.
g. Concern for the self disappears and paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow exp concludes.
The autotelic personality refers to a self-contained avtiviry, one that is done not with the expectation of some future benefit, but simply because the doing itself is the reward.
