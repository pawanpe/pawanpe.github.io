# CHAPTER 18: Test Strategy Patterns

## Recorded Test (Record and Playback):
1. Purposes of automated tests: 
    a) Can be used for regression testing software
    b) Help document the behavior of the software
    c) Can specify the behavior of the software before it has been changed.
2. RT can be used to rapidly build regression test suite after the SUT is built and before its changed.
3. If we want to use Tests as Documentation or if we want to use the tests to drive new development, we should consider using Scripted Tests.
4. Sometimes RT can be built into the application (SUT) itself in order to let us define the tests in the same Higher Level language of SUT.
5. A good strategy is to use hybrid, i.e Record, refactor and playback sequence to extract a set of "action components" and create Test Utility methods instead of having detailed inline code.
6. Built in test recording tool in SUT: On the surface, it doesn't seem to make sense to provide a code sample for a recorded test, because built in
machanism deals with how the test is produced, not how the test in represented. When the test is played back, it is in effect a Data-Driven test. 
Nevertheless, we might introduce a Recorded Test after attempting Scripted Tests if we discover that we have too many missing Tests because the cost
of manual automation is very high. In that case we would not try to convert the existing Scripted test to Recorded test, we would just record new tests.

## Data-Driven Test:

## Test Automation Framework:

## Minimal fixture:
