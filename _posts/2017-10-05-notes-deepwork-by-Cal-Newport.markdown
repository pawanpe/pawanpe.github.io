<b style="color: brown">Introduction:</b>

1. DeepWork: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill and are hard to replicate.
2. ShallowWork: Non cognitively demanding, logistical style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
3. Three to four hours a day, five days a week of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out can produce a lot of valuable output.

<b style="color: brown">Rule #4 Drain the Shallows:</b>

1. Basecamp company started an experiment in 2007 to shortened their work week from five days to four.
a. The point of the 4 day work week is about doing less work. It’s not about four 10 hour days,, it’s ablur four normalish 8 hour days. Once everyone has less time to get their stuff done, they respect that time even more. People become stringy with their time and that a good thing because they don’t waste it on things that just don’t matter.
b. Craving one day out of an otherwise busy week easy is not enough to support the type if unbroken deep work that generates true breakthroughs. Better to take 5 days in a row than 5 days spread out over 5 weeks.
c. The shallow work that increasingly dominates the time and attention of knowledge workers is less vital than it often seems in the moment.
d. Deep work is exhausting because it pushes you toward the limit of your abilities. There is a limit to the deep work ability. Scientists have found that once a person hits the deep work limit in a given day, he/she experience diminishing rewards if try to cram in more.
e. The author is asking to treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly underestimated and its importance vastly overestimated. This type of work is inevitable, but you must keep it confined to a point where it doesn't impede you ability to take full advantage of the deeper efforts that ultimately determine your impact. 

Below strategies will help:
2. Schedule every minute of your day -- We spend much of our day on autopilot not giving much thought to what we’re doing with our rime. This is a problem.

3. Quantify the depth of every activity -- Helps to recognize the shallow work done daily and reduce it.
	a. Shallow work: Noncgnitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. There efforts not create much new value in the works and are ready to replicate.

4. Ask your Boss for a Shallow work Budget -- example: This budget might lead you to deep the need for a weekly status meeting in preference for results-driven reporting.(let me know when there is a significant progress, we will talk)

5. Finish your work by 5:30 P.M -- Fixed-schedule productivity -- Do what is necessary and interesting.

6. Become Hard to Reach -- But be ready to develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don’t, you'll never find time for the life-changing big things.

<b style="color: brown">Rule #1 Work Deeply:</b>
	
1. Eudaimonia machine is a good example of the intersection of conceptual and the concrete  knowledge. The goal of the machine is to create a setting where the users can get into a state of deep human flourishing creating work that is at the absolute extent of their personal abilities.

2. There is a finite amount of will power that becomes depleted as you use it. Once, depleted don’t push it. Just go to sleep.

Decide on your depth philosophy:
3. Monastic philosophy
	a. People who just work deeply for long period of time and avoiding everything like 3-6 months even mails and purchasing grocery etc.

4. Bimodal philosophy
	a. Deep work for days together and then move to shallow work activities.
	b. Check Adam Grant -- Give and Take book.

5. The Rhythmic philosophy
	a. The philosophy states that the easier way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. Generate a rhythm for the deep work like certain hours every morning.

6. The Journalistic philosophy
	a. Move in and out of deep work state when ever there is time. Experience people can perform this without complications.
	b. Check Evan Thomas -- The Wide Men: Six Friends and the World they made.

7. Have a Ritual Habit:
	a. It is recommended that creative people should think like artists and work like accountants.

8. Make grand gestures: lnvest materialistically in the task to complete.

9. The four disciplines of the 4DX framework:
	a. Focus on the wildly important
		i. Individual focused on deep work, should identify a small # of ambitious outcomes to pursue with deep work hours.
	b. Act on the lead measures.
		i. Lag measure describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve.
		ii. Lead measure on the other hand, measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures. For individuals the lead measure is time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward you wildly important goal.

10. Shutdown rituals and reflect your goals with a pen and paper or apps.

<b style="color: brown">Rule #3 Quit Social Media:</b>

	There is nothing much for me to take notes here. Just quit social media apps and stop watching youtube. I skipped this chapter and passed my time buying groceries.

<b style="color: brown">Rule #2 Embrace Boredom:</b>

1. The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained. This idea might sound obvious once it's pointed out, but it represents a departure from how most people understand such matters. In my experience, it’s common to treat undistracted concentration as a habit like flossing- something that you know how to do and know is good for you. But that you've been neglecting due to a lack of motivation. This mind-set is appealing because it implies you can transform your working life from distracted to focused overnight if you can simply muster enough motivation. But this understanding ignores the difficulty of focus and the hours of practice necessary to strengthen your "mental muscle".

2. Constant attention switching online has a lasting negative effect on your brain.

3. Getting the most our of the deep work habit required training and this training must address two goals: improving your ability to concentrate intensely and overcoming your desire for distraction.

4. Working with great intense concentration. Attack the task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration.

5. Learn about memory place techniques. Lack of attention is a killer for a task to accomplish.

<b style="color: brown">Deep Work is rare:</b>

1. It is objectively difficult to measure individual contributions to a firm's output. In the absence of such measures, irrational outcomes, such as executive salaries way out of proportion to the executive's marginal productivity, can occur.

2. Shop Class as Soulcraft, he quit his job as a Washington, D.C, think tank director to open a motorcycle repair shop exactly to escape this bewilderment. The feeling of raking a broken machine, struggling with it, then eventually enjoying a tangible indication that he had succeeded (the bike driving out of the shop under its own power) provides a concrete sense of accomplishment he struggled to replicate when his day revolved vaguely around reports and communications strategies. A similar reality created problems for many knowledge workers

3. We no longer are discussing the trade offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the new efficiencies against the new  problems introduced. If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it's good. Case closed. Such a culture a technopoly. It doesn't make it illegal or immoral. It doesn't even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant.

<b style="color: brown">Deep Work is Meaningful:</b>

1. Elder people will not be happier because their life circumstances were better than those of the younger people. They were instead happier because they had rewired their brains to ignore the negative and savor the positive. By skillfully managing their attention, they improved their world without changing anything concrete about it.

2. Concentration on a deep work activity so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems.

3. Choose life targets with care and them give them rapt attention. In short live the focused life, because it’s the best kind there is.

4. The best moments usually occur when a  person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a  voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.

5. Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges. All of which encourage one to becoe=me involved in one's work to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand,, is unstructured and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.

6. If we give rapt attention to important things and therefore also ignore shallow negative things, we'll experience out working life as more important and positive. Csikszentmihalyi's theory of flow, by contrast is mostly agnostic to the content of out attention.

7. ATTEMPT-->FLOW-->DEEPWORK-->RESULTS-->STOIC-->POWERNAPS. (Not in the book)

8. To build a working life around the experience of flow  produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.

<b style="color: brown">Deep Work is Valuable:</b>

1. Core abilities for thriving in the new economy:
	a. The ability to quickly master hard things.
	b.  The ability to produce at an elite level in terms of both quality and speed.

2. The dependency of the above abilities on deep work isn’t immediately obvious. It requires a closer look at the science of learning, concentration and productivity.

3. To advance the understanding of your field you must tackle the relevant topics systematically, allowing your converging rays of attention to uncover the truth latent in each. Deliberate practice with intense concentration.

4. To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. If you're comfortable going deep, you'll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive in our economy. If you instead remain one of the many for whom depth is uncomfortable and distraction ubiquitous, you shouldn't expect these systems and skills to come easily to you.

5. Central method to follow: the batching of hard but important intellectual work into long, uninterrupted stretches.

6. High quality work produced = Time Spent * Intensity of Focus

7. To produce at peak level a person has to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distracting.
